According to Articles, the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut, which earlier in 2023 achieved an incredible top speed of 330 mph, will hold the title of the fastest car in the world by 2023. Although the car's twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8 produces 1,600 horsepower and 1,106 pound-feet of torque, which is a big part of what makes it fast, the developers at Koenigsegg have given the vehicle much more than just incredible power.

The Jesko Absolut boasts a nine-speed transmission that shifts so fast it's nearly undetectable and has an extremely slippery 0.278 drag coefficient. Its shifts occur at nearly the speed of light, according to Koenigsegg, who refers to it as a Light Speed Transmission (LST). Even if that may be a little overkill, the gearbox is remarkable because it has many wet multi-disc clutches and is incredibly lightweight.
