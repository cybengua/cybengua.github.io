According to Articles, the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut, which earlier in 2023 achieved an incredible top speed of 330 mph, will hold the title of the fastest car in the world by 2023. Although the car's twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8 produces 1,600 horsepower and 1,106 pound-feet of torque, which is a big part of what makes it fast, the developers at Koenigsegg have given the vehicle much more than just incredible power.

The Jesko Absolut boasts a nine-speed transmission that shifts so fast it's nearly undetectable and has an extremely slippery 0.278 drag coefficient. Its shifts occur at nearly the speed of light, according to Koenigsegg, who refers to it as a Light Speed Transmission (LST). Even if that may be a little overkill, the gearbox is remarkable because it has many wet multi-disc clutches and is incredibly lightweight.

The Koenigsegg Jesko is a limited edition mid-engine sports car manufactured by the Swedish automaker Koenigsegg. The automobile was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor event and sold out before the event concluded. It replaces the Agera. The name Jesko is a tribute to the firm founder's father, Jesko von Koenigsegg. The car comes in two variants: "Absolut" (peak speed) and "Attack" (track-focused).

# What goes into making an automobile that can go at speeds greater than 300 mph, you ask?

Although the Jesko Absolut and Bolide's multiple-seven-figure price tags would suggest that reaching 300 mph or more is simple, achieving these astounding top speeds requires a lot of effort. Apart from the fact that the cars must go on miles of glassy-smooth pavement, they also need to be incredibly aerodynamic and able to suck in large amounts of air, which results in massive fuel consumption at those speeds. In order to keep the car on the ground, engineers must design it so that it can slice through the air with ease and produce a lot of downforce.

Almost every component of the automobile is put under stress when hundreds of pounds of downforce are added, particularly the tires and suspension. The car's temporary weight must be supported by the dampers in order to maintain tire contact with the pavement. Even little flaws in the road surface become more noticeable and forceful at 300 mph, therefore the car needs to be able to handle this.

*How to build a 300mph Koenigsegg Jesko*

Tires receive an especially hard hammering during high-speed runs, as the downforce compresses the sidewalls. They are also subjected to high temperatures as a result of the friction caused by rubber clawing against the pavement at 300 mph. Tires rotate thousands of times per minute at that speed, therefore they must be strong enough to withstand the intense rotational forces. Finally, high speeds have an odd effect on the weights of car components, such as tire pressure monitoring sensors, which can weigh many times their typical weight when rotating at 300 mph, causing wheel imbalances and other problems.
