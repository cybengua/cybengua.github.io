According to Articles, the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut, which earlier in 2023 achieved an incredible top speed of 330 mph, will hold the title of the fastest car in the world by 2023. Although the car's twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8 produces 1,600 horsepower and 1,106 pound-feet of torque, which is a big part of what makes it fast, the developers at Koenigsegg have given the vehicle much more than just incredible power.

The Jesko Absolut boasts a nine-speed transmission that shifts so fast it's nearly undetectable and has an extremely slippery 0.278 drag coefficient. Its shifts occur at nearly the speed of light, according to Koenigsegg, who refers to it as a Light Speed Transmission (LST). Even if that may be a little overkill, the gearbox is remarkable because it has many wet multi-disc clutches and is incredibly lightweight.

# How expensive is the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut?

If you're wondering how much the fastest automobile in the world costs, it's just another dizzying figure on the Jesko Absolut's spec sheet. All 125 Absolut automobiles were sold out for about $3 million. Being able to purchase the Koenigsegg is only the first step toward reaching its full potential. There are very few areas on the map that can handle a 300-plus-mph run, and those that can are in inconvenient locations. However, it's possible that many people who paid for a Jesko Absolut will be satisfied with the bragging rights rather than the speed.

So, while the Jesko Absolut holds the speed record with more than a few miles per hour to spare, the other cars in the 300-mph club are nearly as spectacular.

# What goes into making an automobile that can go at speeds greater than 300 mph, you ask?

Although the Jesko Absolut and Bolide's multiple-seven-figure price tags would suggest that reaching 300 mph or more is simple, achieving these astounding top speeds requires a lot of effort. Apart from the fact that the cars must go on miles of glassy-smooth pavement, they also need to be incredibly aerodynamic and able to suck in large amounts of air, which results in massive fuel consumption at those speeds. In order to keep the car on the ground, engineers must design it so that it can slice through the air with ease and produce a lot of downforce.

Almost every component of the automobile is put under stress when hundreds of pounds of downforce are added, particularly the tires and suspension. The car's temporary weight must be supported by the dampers in order to maintain tire contact with the pavement. Even little flaws in the road surface become more noticeable and forceful at 300 mph, therefore the car needs to be able to handle this.

*How to build a 300mph Koenigsegg Jesko*

Tires receive an especially hard hammering during high-speed runs, as the downforce compresses the sidewalls. They are also subjected to high temperatures as a result of the friction caused by rubber clawing against the pavement at 300 mph. Tires rotate thousands of times per minute at that speed, therefore they must be strong enough to withstand the intense rotational forces. Finally, high speeds have an odd effect on the weights of car components, such as tire pressure monitoring sensors, which can weigh many times their typical weight when rotating at 300 mph, causing wheel imbalances and other problems.

The wonderful Koenigsegg Jesko launched what seems like a lifetime ago. It debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2019, followed a year later by the top-speed-focused Jesko Absolut. Since then, the globe has seen a global epidemic, significant supply chain disruptions caused by technology shortages, financial turmoil, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It may seem like a lifetime ago, but the Jesko Absolut is still alive and well.
